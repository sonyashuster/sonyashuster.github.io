<!-- For Section 3 of the assignment, I did the table, the Google Maps Static API maps,

<h1>Places I've Lived</h1>

<p>While I've only ever had one "home", I've lived in a total of nine "dwellings" in 
three cities/towns in two provinces. I'm going to show them to you.</p>

<h2>"Home" (aka Toronto)</h2>

<p> I grew up in Toronto, near High Park. I moved back home almost two years ago 
	and have lived there ever since. High Park is the largest park entirely within 
	the city of Toronto. Among other things, it has an epic castle playground
	and multiple ponds with lots of ducks, geese, and other wildlife; 
	there's even a small zoo. </p>
